# Facial-Recognition-System
### Facial Recognition with Haar Cascade using OpenCV
This GitHub repository contains code for a facial recognition project implemented in Python 3 using computer vision principles and Haar Cascade classifiers from the OpenCV library. The project utilizes the power of computer vision to detect and recognize human faces in images or video streams.

## Features
Face detection: The project leverages Haar Cascade classifiers, a machine learning-based approach, to detect human faces in images or video frames.
Face recognition: Once the faces are detected, the system utilizes OpenCV's face recognition algorithms to recognize individuals based on pre-trained models.
Real-time processing: The code is designed to process live video streams in real-time, making it suitable for applications such as surveillance systems or video-based attendance tracking.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition.git

Navigate to the project directory:


cd facial-recognition
Create a virtual environment to install the project dependencies:


python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:


source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier XML file for face detection. You can find the file at OpenCV GitHub repository. Save the XML file in the project directory.

## Usage
To use the facial recognition system, follow these steps:

Ensure that your webcam or video source is connected and accessible by OpenCV.

Run the facial_recognition.py script:

python facial_recognition.py

The system will start capturing frames from the video source and perform real-time face detection and recognition. Detected faces will be highlighted, and if recognized, their names or labels will be displayed.

Press 'q' to quit the application.

Customization and Extension
The project can be extended or customized to suit specific requirements:

Training: To train the face recognition model with your own dataset, you can use the train_model.py script. This script allows you to collect facial images of individuals and create a custom face recognition model based on the collected data.

Model selection: The project uses OpenCV's built-in face recognition algorithms, but you can experiment with other models or deep learning frameworks to achieve higher accuracy or specific functionality.

UI development: If desired, you can enhance the project by building a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide a user-friendly interaction with the facial recognition system.
